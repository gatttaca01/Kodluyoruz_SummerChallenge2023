PROJELER:

WEEK1:
*EASY : Write an algorithm to find how old the user is by taking their date of birth.

Algorithm: 

-Get year of birth from user(birthDate)
-Get input from user in which year(year)
-Find the user's age by subtracting the birthdate variable from the year variable.
-Print to screen.

*MEDIUM : Get a text from the user. You must find the most repeated letter in this text and show how many times it is repeated.

Algorithm: 

-Get a text input from the user.
-Create a dictionary (dictionary). This dictionary will store how many times each letter is repeated.
-Cycle through each character in the text:
    If the character is a letter:
        Convert it to lowercase (to ignore the difference between upper and lower case).
        Check the dictionary:
            If the character is not in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary and set the value to 1.
            If the character is in the dictionary, increase the value by one.
-Find the letter with the highest value in the dictionary.
-Report the result to the user.

Optional
*HARD : Construct an array of integers. In line with the target number you receive from the user, select numbers from the number sequence and add them to reach the target number.
! It is important to reach the target number with different combinations.
